# recipe

a simple recipe program written with Ruby. I made this in the 1st week of the Codaisseur program to learn more about Ruby. You can run it in the Terminal, it will show you the ingredients and steps to make Pasta Carbonara! It will ask you if you have all the ingredients, if not, it tells you to go shopping. If you do, it will show you the steps you need to follow.
A very nice way to make an interactive app within the first week of learning how to code.
